	write a function that write a string in reverse

task 2
	write a function that gives the length of a string

task 3
	write a function that returns the factorial of a given number

task 4
	write a funvtion that returns the value of c raised to the power of y

task 5
	Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

task 6
	Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

task 7
	Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
