Today we gonna see another knowledge which is the memory allocation. 
so the project is 0x0B-malloc-free.

let's desrcribe a little the malloc and free function:
	malloc:
		- function included in the <stdlib.h> library.
		- allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

	free:
		- when the allocated memory is not needed anymore we must liberat it to the operating system by calling the free function.
