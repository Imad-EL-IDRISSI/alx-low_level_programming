Search Algorithm

This project contains an implementation of the search algorithm in C.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Files should end with a new line
- Code should follow the Betty style guidelines
- No global variables are allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only the `printf` function from the standard library is allowed
- The prototype of the linear search function is included in the `search_algos.h` header file
- Header files are include guarded

## Function-0 Prototype

```c
int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
